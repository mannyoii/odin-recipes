    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Next up is the classic Matar Paneer. In Hindi, Matar translates to peas,
      and Paneer refers to a fresh cheese made in India, one of the main
      ingredients in this dish. Matar Paneer is a North Indian dish consisting
      of peas and paneer cooked in a mild tomato sauce like the Butter Chicken,
      except Matar Paneer is seasoned with Garam Masala, a blend of ground
      spices. Matar Paneer is traditionally served with Indian bread such as
      naan or aloo paratha but is also eaten by some with rice. Sometimes, other
      ingredients such as potatoes may be added.
