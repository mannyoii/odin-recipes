    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Butter Chicken or Makhan Murg in Hindi is one of the most popular Indian dishes. Makhan, in Hindi, stands for Butter, and Murg means chicken, which literally translates to butter chicken. Initially originating in the northern Indian state of Punjab, butter chicken features a beautifully cooked chicken mixed in with a tomato curry sauce, resulting in a famous curry that has gained international fame. Butter chicken was accidentally invented in the Moti Mahal restaurant in New Delhi when leftover chicken pieces were mixed with sauce. This dish is enjoyed with naan, roti, or even with rice.</p>
