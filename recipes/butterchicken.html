    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Butter Chicken or Makhan Murg in Hindi is one of the most popular Indian
      dishes. Makhan, in Hindi, stands for Butter, and Murg means chicken, which
      literally translates to butter chicken. Initially originating in the
      northern Indian state of Punjab, butter chicken features a beautifully
      cooked chicken mixed in with a tomato curry sauce, resulting in a famous
      curry that has gained international fame. Butter chicken was accidentally
      invented in the Moti Mahal restaurant in New Delhi when leftover chicken
      pieces were mixed with sauce. This dish is enjoyed with naan, roti, or
      even with rice.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup butter, divided</li>
      <li>1 onion, minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
      <li>3 cups heavy cream</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
      <li>
        1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into bite-sized chunks
      </li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons tandoori masala</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Melt a few tablespoons of butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in
        onion and garlic, and cook slowly until the onion caramelizes to a dark
        brown, about 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile melt the remaining butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat
        along with the tomato sauce, heavy cream, salt, cayenne pepper, and
        garam masala. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low; cover,
        and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Then stir in
        caramelized onions.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the sauce is simmering, toss cubed chicken breast with vegetable
        oil until coated, then season with tandoori masala and spread out onto a
        baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake chicken in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about
        12 minutes. Once done, add the chicken to the sauce and simmer for 5
        minutes before serving.
