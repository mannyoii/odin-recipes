    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Tandoori chicken is another North Indian dish that may have been around in
      3000 BC. Tandoori Chicken derives its name from the vessel it's cooked in,
      known as a Tandoor Oven. It is a cylindrical-shaped oven that is powered
      by burning wood or charcoal. The Tandoor Oven is made of either clay or
      metal and offers a distinct taste to meals cooked within it. Tandoori
      Chicken consists of chicken marinated for a few days in a mixture of
      yogurt and tandoori masala, a blend of traditional Indian spices.
      Following this, the chicken is then cooked.
