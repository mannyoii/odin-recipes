    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tandoori chicken is another North Indian dish that may have been around in 3000 BC. Tandoori Chicken derives its name from the vessel it's cooked in, known as a Tandoor Oven. It is a cylindrical-shaped oven that is powered by burning wood or charcoal. The Tandoor Oven is made of either clay or metal and offers a distinct taste to meals cooked within it. Tandoori Chicken consists of chicken marinated for a few days in a mixture of yogurt and tandoori masala, a blend of traditional Indian spices. Following this, the chicken is then cooked.</p>
